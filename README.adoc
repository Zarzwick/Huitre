= Huître - A Celcat-ics "compiler"

A Celcat extractor done in Perl 6.

== Why ?

Because.

It is built to read XML plannings of the Université Paul Sabatier (which doesn't provide .ics by itself...).

It does work on the Computer Graphics planning, I don't know for others. *It was mostly a good occasion to learn Perl :)*.
By the way, don't be horrified by the code and "architecture", this is a working WIP.

== Requirements

Because I used a custom grammar (wich is probably ugly), the only required package is LibCurl (`zef install LibCurl`).

== Performance

Hum....

Seriously, it may be considered fast or very slow. Someone I know addressed the same goal with python, I may compare one day. This program on my planning take a bit less than a second (download + parsing), which I find fair for my personal use, and considering that the planning are updated once a day.
