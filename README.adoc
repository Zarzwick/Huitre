= Huître - A Celcat-ics "compiler"

A Celcat extractor done in Perl 6, 

== Why ?

Because.

It is built to read XML plannings of the Université Paul Sabatier (which doesn't provide .ics by itself...).

It does work on the Computer Graphics planning, I don't know for others. It was mostly a good occasion to learn Perl :)

== Requirements

Because I used a custom grammar, the only required package is LibCurl (`zef install LibCurl`).
